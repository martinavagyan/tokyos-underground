        <h3>
            Nishi-Ogikubo
        </h3>
        <p>
          This town is located at the western edge of the 23 central wards of Tokyo.
          One station to the left and you’re out of the city. Yet it is everything 
          else then boring: Being one of the centers of counterculture since the 1960s, 
          the are is home to a lot of independent businesses, artsy shops and high-end 
          craftsmen. Near the train station you will see a large concentration of 
          local pubs & bars, each and every one offering their own unique flavor. 
          Chain-stores are a No-Go in these streets, and the area is staring to 
          become popular among creative foreigners as well.

        <h3>
          Asagaya
        </h3>
        <p>
          Located in the heart of Suginami Ward, Asagaya does not lack in the 
          creative vibe either. The area is home to Tokyo’s Jazz scene, and 
          there is Jazz festival called “Asagaya Jazz streets” held annually. 
          While on the south exit you can find a traditional Japanese shopping 
          street (known as Shotengai) with an abundance in restaurants, the 
          north exit is home to large concentration of independently owned pubs,
          particularly in Tachi-nomi style (standing bars). Every pub has their 
          own speciality, and you can find a variety of street-food here.

        <h3>
            Koenji
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is a shame if you haven’t visited Koenji during a Tokyo trip
          (even though this applies to 95% of the people). Sometimes being 
          referred to as the “India of Japan”, the town was center of Tokyo’s 
          Hippie movement in the 1970s. Even today the town attracts Tokyo’s 
          creatives (including Fumi, who lives here), and you can find tons of 
          second-hand shops, unique cafes and live venues scattered around the area. 
          The area is also not short on nightlife, so here you can find some of 
          the best locals pubs and late-night food in the entire city.
